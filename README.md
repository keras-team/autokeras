##
AutoKeras: An AutoML system based on Keras.
It is developed by <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DATA Lab</a> at Texas A&M University.
The goal of AutoKeras is to make machine learning accessible to everyone.

## Example

Here is a short example of using the package.

```python
import autokeras as ak

clf = ak.ImageClassifier()
clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
results = clf.predict(x_test)
```

For a detailed tutorial, please check [here](https://autokeras.com/tutorial/overview/).

## Installation

To install the package, please use the `pip` installation as follows:

```shell
pip3 install autokeras
```

Please follow the [installation guide](https://autokeras.com/install) for more details.

**Note:** Currently, AutoKeras is only compatible with **Python >= 3.5** and **TensorFlow >= 2.3.0**.

## Contributing Code

We engage in keeping everything about AutoKeras open to the public.
Everyone can easily join as a developer.
Here is how we manage our project.

* **Triage the issues**: 
We pick the critical issues to work on from [GitHub issues](https://github.com/keras-team/autokeras/issues).
They will be added to this [Project](https://github.com/keras-team/autokeras/projects/3).
Some of the issues will then be added to the [milestones](https://github.com/keras-team/autokeras/milestones),
which are used to plan for the releases.
* **Assign the tasks**: We assign the tasks to people during the online meetings.
* **Discuss**: We can have discussions in multiple places. The code reviews are on GitHub.
Questions can be asked in Slack or during meetings.

Please join our [Slack](https://autokeras.com/#community) and send Haifeng Jin a message.
Or drop by our [online meetings](https://autokeras.com/#community) and talk to us.
We will help you get started!

Refer to our [Contributing Guide](https://autokeras.com/contributing/) to learn the best practices.

Thank all the contributors!
