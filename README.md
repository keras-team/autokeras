Auto-Keras is an open source software library for automated machine learning (AutoML).
It is developed by <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DATA Lab</a> at Texas A&M University and community contributors.
The ultimate goal of AutoML is to provide easily accessible deep learning tools to domain experts with limited data science or machine learning background. 
Auto-Keras provides functions to automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep learning models.

## Example

Here is a short example of using the package.


    import autokeras as ak

    clf = ak.ImageClassifier()
    clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
    results = clf.predict(x_test)
