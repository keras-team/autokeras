##

AutoKeras is an open source software library for automated machine learning (AutoML).
It is developed by <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DATA Lab</a> at Texas A&M University and community contributors.
The ultimate goal of AutoML is to provide easily accessible deep learning tools to domain experts with limited data science or machine learning background.
AutoKeras provides functions to automatically search for architecture and hyperparameters of deep learning models.

# AutoKeras 1.0 is coming soon!

## Installation

To install the package, please use the `pip` installation as follows:

```shell
pip3 install autokeras # for 0.4 version
pip3 install autokeras==1.0.0b0 # for 1.0 version
```

**Note:** currently, AutoKeras is only compatible with: **Python 3**.

## Example

Here is a short example of using the package.

```
import autokeras as ak

clf = ak.ImageClassifier()
clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
results = clf.predict(x_test)
```
