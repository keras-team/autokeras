## Pull Request Guidelines
Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:
1.	Give your pull request a **helpful title** that summarizes what your contribution does.
2.  Also, **add the issue number** which it addresses. If there is no associated issue, feel free to [create one](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/issues).
2.	Often pull requests resolve one or more other issues. If merging your pull request means that some other issues/PRs should be closed, you should use keywords to link to them.
3.	If the pull request adds functionality, the **docs should be updated**. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring and add the feature to the list in README.rst.
4.	Please prefix the title of your pull request with [MRG] if the contribution is complete and should be subjected to a detailed review. An incomplete contribution – where you expect to do more work before receiving a full review – should be prefixed [WIP] (to indicate a work in progress) and changed to [MRG] when it matures. 
5.	For the case of bug fixes, at the time of the PR, the test case should fail for the code base in the master branch and pass for the PR code.
6.	If you are proposing a feature:
    * Explain in detail how it would work.
    * Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
