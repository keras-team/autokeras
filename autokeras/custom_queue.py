class SharedCounter():
    """ A synchronized shared counter.

    The locking done by multiprocessing.Value ensures that only a single
    process or thread may read or write the in-memory ctypes object. However,
    in order to do n += 1, Python performs a read followed by a write, so a
    second process may read the old value before the new one is written by the
    first process. The solution is to use a multiprocessing.Lock to guarantee
    the atomicity of the modifications to Value.

    This class comes almost entirely from Eli Bendersky's blog:

class Queue(multiprocessing.queues.Queue):
    """ A portable implementation of multiprocessing.Queue.

    Because of multithreading / multiprocessing semantics, Queue.qsize() may
    raise the NotImplementedError exception on Unix platforms like Mac OS X
    where sem_getvalue() is not implemented. This subclass addresses this
    problem by using a synchronized shared counter (initialized to zero) and
    increasing / decreasing its value every time the put() and get() methods
    are called, respectively. This not only prevents NotImplementedError from
    being raised, but also allows us to implement a reliable version of both
    qsize() and empty().
