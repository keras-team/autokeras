        num_classes: Int. Defaults to None. If None, it will be inferred from the
            data.
        multi_label: Boolean. Defaults to False.
        loss: A Keras loss function. Defaults to use 'binary_crossentropy' or
            'categorical_crossentropy' based on the number of classes.
        metrics: A list of Keras metrics. Defaults to use 'accuracy'.
        project_name: String. The name of the AutoModel.
            Defaults to 'image_classifier'.
        max_trials: Int. The maximum number of different Keras Models to try.
            The search may finish before reaching the max_trials. Defaults to 100.
        directory: String. The path to a directory for storing the search outputs.
            Defaults to None, which would create a folder with the name of the
            AutoModel in the current directory.
        objective: String. Name of model metric to minimize
            or maximize, e.g. 'val_accuracy'. Defaults to 'val_loss'.
        tuner: String or subclass of AutoTuner. If string, it should be one of
            'greedy', 'bayesian', 'hyperband' or 'random'. It can also be a subclass
            of AutoTuner. If left unspecified, it uses a task specific tuner, which
            first evaluates the most commonly used models for the task before
            exploring other models.
        overwrite: Boolean. Defaults to `False`. If `False`, reloads an existing
            project of the same name if one is found. Otherwise, overwrites the
            project.
        seed: Int. Random seed.
        max_model_size: Int. Maximum number of scalars in the parameters of a
            model. Models larger than this are rejected.
        **kwargs: Any arguments supported by AutoModel.

        It will search for the best model based on the performances on
        validation data.

        # Arguments
            x: numpy.ndarray or tensorflow.Dataset. Training data x. The shape of
                the data should be (samples, width, height)
                or (samples, width, height, channels). If it's a tensorflow.Dataset
                only x is used, and each sample has an image, and corresponding
                (bboxes, classIDs).
            y: numpy.ndarray. Training data y. They are the
                tuples of bounding boxes and their corresponding class IDs w.r.t.
                the images in x. Each bounding box is defined by 4 values
                [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]. Box coordinates are measured from top left
                image corner, are 0-indexed and proportional to sides i.e. between
                [0,1]. Shape of the bounding boxes should be (None, 4), and shape of
                the classIDs should be (None,) in each tuple, where None represents
                the number of bounding boxes in a single image.
            epochs: Int. The number of epochs to train each model during the search.
                If unspecified, by default we train for a maximum of 1000 epochs,
                but we stop training if the validation loss stops improving for 10
                epochs (unless you specified an EarlyStopping callback as part of
                the callbacks argument, in which case the EarlyStopping callback you
                specified will determine early stopping).
            callbacks: List of Keras callbacks to apply during training and
                validation.
            validation_split: Float between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.2.
                Fraction of the training data to be used as validation data.
                The model will set apart this fraction of the training data,
                will not train on it, and will evaluate
                the loss and any model metrics
                on this data at the end of each epoch.
                The validation data is selected from the last samples
                in the `x` and `y` data provided, before shuffling. This argument is
                not supported when `x` is a dataset.
                The best model found would be fit on the entire dataset including the
                validation data.
            validation_data: Data on which to evaluate the loss and any model metrics
                at the end of each epoch. The model will not be trained on this data.
                `validation_data` will override `validation_split`. The type of the
                validation data should be the same as the training data.
                The best model found would be fit on the training dataset without the
                validation data.
