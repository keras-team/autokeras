    # Arguments
        num_classes: Int. Defaults to None. If None, it will be inferred from the
            data.
        multi_label: Boolean. Defaults to False.
        loss: A Keras loss function. Defaults to use 'binary_crossentropy' or
            'categorical_crossentropy' based on the number of classes.
        metrics: A list of Keras metrics. Defaults to use 'accuracy'.
        project_name: String. The name of the AutoModel.
            Defaults to 'text_classifier'.
        max_trials: Int. The maximum number of different Keras Models to try.
            The search may finish before reaching the max_trials. Defaults to 100.
        directory: String. The path to a directory for storing the search outputs.
            Defaults to None, which would create a folder with the name of the
            AutoModel in the current directory.
        objective: String. Name of model metric to minimize
            or maximize, e.g. 'val_accuracy'. Defaults to 'val_loss'.
        tuner: String or subclass of AutoTuner. If string, it should be one of
            'greedy', 'bayesian', 'hyperband' or 'random'. It can also be a subclass
            of AutoTuner. If left unspecified, it uses a task specific tuner, which
            first evaluates the most commonly used models for the task before
            exploring other models.
        overwrite: Boolean. Defaults to `False`. If `False`, reloads an existing
            project of the same name if one is found. Otherwise, overwrites the
            project.
        seed: Int. Random seed.
        max_model_size: Int. Maximum number of scalars in the parameters of a
            model. Models larger than this are rejected.
