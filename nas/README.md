# Neural Architecture Search

To help the researchers to do experiments on neural architecture search (NAS),
we have implemented several baseline methods using the Auto-Keras framework.
The implementations are easy since only the core part of the search algorithm is needed.
All other parts of NAS (e.g. data structures for storing neural architectures, training of the neural networks)
are done by the Auto-Keras framework.
