# Contributing Guide

Contributions are welcome, and greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.
**The type of contribution we would be most happy to see is new task modules, e.g. TextClassifier, VideoClassifier.**

## Implement New Task Modules
A task module is a comparatively separate module which can handle a specify task.
For example, ImageClassifier is the only task module we have for now.
The list of task modules we are seeking is all the issues with label "new task module" (in progress).

The new task module should be submitted by pull request from the first day you start to develop the module.
Make sure your pull request follow the [Pull Request Guideline](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
Your module will be run against our reserved datasets to test the performance.
If your module's performance meets our expectation,
the new task module will be merged into Auto-Keras package.

In general, all new task module should inherit their objects from the `Classifier` class in [`autokeras/classifier.py`](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/autokeras/classifier.py).
Reach out to us if you feel there is a special requirement.
For every new feature, a new directory should be created inside the /autokeras directory, e.g. text_classifier.
All the code contributed should be within the directory.
The details of the functions to inherit is in the documentation of [`autokeras/classifier.py`](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/autokeras/classifier.py)

## Other Contributions
There are many other ways to contribute to Auto-Keras,
including submit feedback, fix bugs, implement features, and write documentation.
The guide for each type of contribution is as follows.

#### Submit Feedback
The feedback should be submitted by creating an issue at [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/issues).
Select the related template (bug report, feature request, or custom) and add the corresponding labels.

#### Fix Bugs:
You may look through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/issues) for bugs.
Anything tagged with "bug report" is open to whoever wants to implement it.
Please follow the 
[Pull Request Guideline](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to submit your pull request.

to ensure your merge request meet our requirements.

#### Implement Features
You may look through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/issues) for feature requests.
Anything tagged with "feature request" is open to whoever wants to implement it.
Please follow the 
[Pull Request Guideline](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to submit your pull request.

to ensure your merge request meet our requirements.

#### Write Documentation
The documentation of Auto-Keras is either directly written into the Markdown files in
[mkdocs directory](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/tree/master/mkdocs/docs),
or automatically extracted from the docstrings by executing the [autogen.py](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/mkdocs/autogen.py).
In the first situation, you only need to change the markdown file.
In the second situation, you need to change the docstrings and execute [autogen.py](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/mkdocs/autogen.py) to update the Markdown files.
Please follow the 
[Pull Request Guideline](https://github.com/jhfjhfj1/autokeras/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to submit your pull request.

[Documentation Guide](#documentation-guide)
to ensure your merge request meet our requirements.

## Code Style Guide

This project tries to closely follow the official Python Style Guide detailed in [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
The docstrings follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#381-docstrings).
Please follow these style guide closely, especially for the docstrings,
which would be extracted automatically to generate the documentation.

Â 
## Documentation Guide:

The documentation should be provided in two ways, docstring, tutorial, and readme file.
We prefer the documentation to be as complete as possible.

### Docstring
All the methods and classes may directly be called by the user need to be documented with docstrings.
The docstrings should contain all the fields required by the [Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#381-docstrings).

### Tutorial
You only need to add tutorials to your code if you are contributing or updating a new task module,
e.g. TextClassifier, VideoClassifier,
or a new function could be directly called by the user.
You can modify `mkdocs/docs/start.md` to add your tutorial.
The code example of your new task module should be added to the `examples` directory.

### Readme File
You only need to add tutorials to your code if you are contributing or updating a new task module,
e.g. TextClassifier, VideoClassifier.
The readme file should be named as `README.md`.
It should be written in Markdown.
The content should contain your name, affiliation, and any reference to the method you use.

## Testing Guide
[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) is used to write the unit tests of Auto-Keras.
You should test your code by writing unit testing code in `tests` directory.
The testing file name should be the `.py` file with a prefix of `test_` in the corresponding directory,
e.g., the name should be `test_layers.py` if the code of which is to test `layer.py`.
The tests should be run in the root directory of the project by executing the `cov.sh` file.
It would output the coverage information into a directory named `htmlcov`.
Please make sure the code coverage percentage does not decrease after your contribution,
otherwise, the code will not be merged.
